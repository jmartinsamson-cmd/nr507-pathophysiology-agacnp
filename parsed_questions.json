Complement proteins ANS: B Albumin (approximately 60% of total plasma protein at a concentration of about 4 g/dl) is the most abundant plasma protein. PTS: 1 REF: Page 946 What is the effect of low plasma albumin? Clotting factors decrease, thus increasing the chance of prolonged bleeding. Fewer immunoglobulins are synthesized, thus impairing the immune function. Less iron is stored, thus increasing the incidence of iron deficiency anemia. Osmotic pressure decreases, thus water moves from the capillaries to the interstitium. ANS: D In the case of decreased production (e.g., cirrhosis, other diffuse liver diseases, protein malnutrition) or excessive loss of albumin (e.g., certain kidney diseases, extensive burns), the reduced oncotic pressure leads to excessive movement of fluid and solutes into the tissues and decreased "

Poikilocytosis c. Anisocytosis Isocytosis d. Microcytosis ANS: C Additional descriptors of erythrocytes associated with some anemias include anisocytosis (assuming various sizes) or poikilocytosis (assuming various shapes) (see Figure 28-1). The remaining terms are not associated with this condition. PTS: 1 REF: Page 982 What is the fundamental physiologic manifestation of anemia? Hypotension c. Hypoxia Hyperesthesia d. Ischemia ANS: C The fundamental physiologic manifestation of anemia is a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, resulting in tissue hypoxia. PTS: 1 REF: Page 982 | Page 985 The paresthesia that occurs in vitNamURinSIBN1G2TdBe.fCiOciMency anemia is a result of which of the following? Reduction in acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic nerves Myelin deg"

Neutrophilia c. Eosinophilia Basophilia d. Monocytosis ANS: C Eosinophilia is an absolute increase (more than 450/¬µL) in the total numbers of circulating eosinophils. Allergic disorders (type I hypersensitivity) associated with asthma, hay fever, and drug reactions, as well as parasitic infections (particularly with metazoal parasites), are often cited as causes. This change is not identified by any of other options. PTS: 1 REF: Pages 1010-1011 In infectious mononucleosis (IM), what does the Monospot test detect? Immunoglobulin E (IgE) c. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Immunoglobulin M (IgM) d. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) ANS: B Heterophile antibodies are a heterogeneous group of IgM antibodies that are agglutinins against nonhuman red blood cells (e.g., sheep, horse) and are detecte"

    "raw_text_sample": "Chapter 32: Structure and Function of the Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems MULTIPLE CHOICE Which statement does not accurately describe the pericardium? The pericardium is a double-walled membranous sac that encloses the heart. It is made up of connective tissue and a surface layer of squamous cells. The pericardium protects the heart against infection and inflammation from the lungs and pleural space. It contains pain and mechanoreceptors that can elicit reflex changes in blood pressure and heart rate. ANS: B The pericardium is made up of a surface layer of mesothelium over a thin layer of connective tissue. The remaining options accurately describe the pericardium. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1085 Which cardiac chamber has the thinnest wall and why? The right and left atria; they are low-pressure chambers that serve as storage units and conduits for blood. The right and left atria; they are not directly involved in the preload, contractility, or afterload of the heart. The left ventricle; t"

Fourth and seventh weeks c. Twelfth and fourteenth weeks Eighth and tenth weeks d. Fifteenth and seventeenth weeks ANS: A Cardiogenesis begins at approximately 3 weeks‚Äô gestation; however, most cardiovascular development occurs between 4 and 7 weeks‚Äô gestation. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1194 The function of the foramen ovale in a fetus allows what to occur? Right-to-left blood shunting c. Blood flow from the umbilical cord Left-to-right blood shunting d. Blood flow to the lungs ANS: A The nonfused septum secundum and ostium secundum result in the formation of a flapped orifice known as the foramen ovale, which allows the right-to-left shunting necessary for fetal circulation. The foramen ovale is not involved in the blood flow described by the other options. PTS: 1 REF: Pages 1195-1196 At birth, which statement is true? Systemic resistance and p"

Nasal turbinates c. Cilia Alveolar macrophages d. Irritant receptors on the nares ANS: C The submucosal glands of the bronchial lining produce mucus, contributing to the mucous blanket that covers the bronchial epithelium. The ciliated epithelial cells rhythmically beat this mucous blanket toward the trachea and pharynx, where it can be swallowed or expectorated by coughing. This selection is the only option that accurately identifies the pulmonary defense mechanism described.

An adult‚Äôs chest wall compliance is lower than an infant‚Äôs. ùóâ. An adult‚Äôs chest wall compliance is higher than an infant‚Äôs. An adult‚Äôs chest wall compliance is the same as an infant‚Äôs. ùõø. An adult‚Äôs chest wall compliance is dissimilar to that of an infant‚Äôs. ANS: A Chest wall compliance is higher in infants than it is in adults, particularly in premature infants. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1292 Why is nasal congestion a serious threat to young infants? ùõº. Infants are obligatory nose breathers. ùóâ. Their noses are small in diameter. Infants become dehydrated when mouth breathing. ùõø. Their epiglottis is proportionally greater than the epiglottis of an adult‚Äôs. ANS: A Infants up to 2 to 3 months of age are obligatory nose breathers and are unable to breathe in through their mouths. Nasal congestion is therefore a serious threat to a young infant. This"
