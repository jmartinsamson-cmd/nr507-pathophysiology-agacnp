          "Clotting factors decrease, thus increasing the chance of prolonged bleeding.",
          "Fewer immunoglobulins are synthesized, thus impairing the immune function.",

        "rationale": "In the case of decreased production (e.g., cirrhosis, other diffuse liver diseases, protein malnutrition) or excessive loss of albumin (e.g., certain kidney diseases, extensive burns), the reduced oncotic pressure leads to excessive movement of fluid and solutes into the tissues and decreased blood volume."
