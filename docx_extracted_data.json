Complement proteins ANS: B Albumin (approximately 60% of total plasma protein at a concentration of about 4 g/dl) is the most abundant plasma protein. PTS: 1 REF: Page 946 What is the effect of low plasma albumin? Clotting factors decrease, thus increasing the chance of prolonged bleeding. Fewer immunoglobulins are synthesized, thus impairing the immune function. Less iron is stored, thus increasing the incidence of iron deficiency anemia. Osmotic pressure decreases, thus water moves from the capillaries to the interstitium. ANS: D In the case of decreased production (e.g., cirrhosis, other diffuse liver diseases, protein malnutrition) or excessive loss of albumin (e.g., certain kidney diseases, extensive burns), the reduced oncotic pressure leads to excessive movement of fluid and solutes into the tissues and decreased blood volume. The other options are not accurate descriptions of the effect of low plasma albumin. PTS: 1 REF: Page 946 What is the life span of an erythrocyte (in days)? 20 to 30 c. 100 to 120 60 to 90 d. 200 to 240 ANS: C Because it cannot undergo mitotic division, the erythrocyte has a limited life span of approximately 120 days. PTS: 1 REF: Pages 947-948 Which statement concerning erythrocytes is true? Erythrocytes contain a nucleus, mitochondria, and ribosomes. Erythrocytes synthesize proteins. Erythrocytes have the ability to change shape to squeeze through microcirculation. Erythrocyte colony-stimulating factor (E-CSF) stimulates erythrocytes. ANS: C Reversible deformity enables the erythrocyte to assume a more compact torpedo-like shape, squeeze through the microcirculation, and return to normal. The other options are not accurate statements about erythrocytes. PTS: 1 REF: Page 948 Granulocytes that contain granules of vasoactive amines, such as histamine, are called: Neutrophils c. Monocytes Eosinophils d. Basophils ANS: D Basophils contain cytoplasmic granules that hold an abundant mixture of biochemical mediators, including histamine, chemotactic factors, proteolytic enzymes, and an anticoagulant (heparin) (see Figure 27-3, C).

    "raw_text": "Chapter 32: Structure and Function of the Cardiovascular and Lymphatic Systems MULTIPLE CHOICE Which statement does not accurately describe the pericardium? The pericardium is a double-walled membranous sac that encloses the heart. It is made up of connective tissue and a surface layer of squamous cells. The pericardium protects the heart against infection and inflammation from the lungs and pleural space. It contains pain and mechanoreceptors that can elicit reflex changes in blood pressure and heart rate. ANS: B The pericardium is made up of a surface layer of mesothelium over a thin layer of connective tissue. The remaining options accurately describe the pericardium. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1085 Which cardiac chamber has the thinnest wall and why? The right and left atria; they are low-pressure chambers that serve as storage units and conduits for blood. The right and left atria; they are not directly involved in the preload, contractility, or afterload of the heart. The left ventricle; the mean pressure of blood coming into this ventricle is from the lung, which has a low pressure. The right ventricle; it pumps bNloUoRdSIiNntGoTtBh.eCOpuMlmonary capillaries, which have a lower pressure compared with the systemic circulation. ANS: A The two atria have the thinnest walls because they are low-pressure chambers that serve as storage units and conduits for blood that is emptied into the ventricles. This selection is the only option that correctly identifies which heart chambers have the thinnest walls and why that helps cardiac function. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1086 Which chamber of the heart endures the highest pressures? Right atrium c. Left ventricle Left atrium d. Right ventricle ANS: C Pressure is greatest in the systemic circulation, driven by the left ventricle. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1086 What is the process that ensures mitral and tricuspid valve closure after the ventricles are filled with blood? Chordae tendineae relax, which allows the valves to close. Increased pressure in the ventricles pushes the valves to close. Trabeculae carneae contract, which pulls the valves closed. Reduced pressure in the atria creates a negative pressure that pulls the valves closed. ANS: B During ventricular relaxation, the two atrioventricular valves open and blood flows from the higher pressure atria to the relaxed ventricles. With increasing ventricular pressure, these valves close and prevent backflow into the atria as the ventricles contract. This selection is the only option that correctly identifies the process that ensures closing of the mitral and tricuspid valves. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1088 Regarding the heartâs valves, what is a function of the papillary muscles? The papillary muscles close the semilunar valve. These muscles prevent backward expulsion of the atrioventricular valve. They close the atrioventricular valve. The papillary muscles open the semilunar valve.

PTS: 1 REF: Page 1232 When an individual aspirates food particles, where would the nurse expect to hear decreased or absent breath sounds? Left lung c. Trachea Right lung d. Carina ANS: B The right mainstem bronchus extends from the trachea more vertically than the left main bronchus; therefore aspirated fluids or foreign particles tend to enter the right lung rather than the left or any of the other locations listed. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1228 Aspiration is most likely to occur in the right mainstem bronchus because it: Extends vertically from the trachea. Is narrower than the left mainstem bronchus. Comes into contact with food and drink first. Is located at the site where the bronchi bifurcate. ANS: A The right mainstem bronchus extends from the trachea more vertically than the left mainstem bronchus; therefore aspirated fluids or foreign particles tend to enter the right lung rather than the left. The size of both mainstems is equal. The trachea comes into contact with food and drink first, and the carina is the site where the bronchi bifurcate. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1228 Air passage among alveoli is collateral and evenly distributed because of the function of which structures? Type I alveolar cells c. Acinus pores Pores of Kohn d. Alveolar pores ANS: B Tiny passages called pores of Kohn permit some air to pass through the septa from alveolus to alveolus, promoting collateral ventilation and even distribution of air among the alveoli. This selection is the only option that accurately describes the function that allows air passage among alveoli. PTS: 1 REF: Page 1229 Where in the lung does gas exchange occur? Trachea c.
